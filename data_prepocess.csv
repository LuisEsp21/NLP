1,True,"11 30, 2012",A34UW9UP2A6TJ8,Linda L.,"This card is NOT ""reedemable"" [sic] ""for any restaurant around the country"".  To utilize the card, you are directed to their website, where you learn what if any restaurants in your zip code take this offer.  In mine, there were only a few restaurants even listed; most are pizza and seedy joints in poor strip centers exclusively.  Not only that, you can't apply the card to the entire order - it only gets you a small ($5, $10) discount toward your check, which must be in excess of a high threshhold.

1,False,"08 1, 2014",A27DYAY3FUWIZ8,J. Kendall,"I can't argue strongly enough against these things. My son got me one for my birthday, which was sweet as heck of him - and the next chance I got, we made plans to go see a movie together. When I arrived at the theater and tried to actually *use* the card, however, I found that you can't do so - the card has to be activated somehow (yet when you go to the fandango site and try to do anything along those lines, all it does is give you a list of movies). In other words, the only way, apparently, you can actually *use* the card is to order your tickets online ahead of the showing.

So, if you aren't positive of which movie you're going to see before you head out, you're out of luck. Given that I don't always know precisely how long it's going to take for us to get all the way across town to the theater, this is an asinine hoop to jump through. Either we can block out an extra hour to see our movie - and sit through forty five minutes of obnoxious, inescapable TV commercials that we *pay* to endure - or I can't use the heartfelt gift my kid gave me. Poor guy spent his own money because he wanted to see a movie with his dad to celebrate my birthday, and, quite frankly, I feel like he got ripped off.

If you want to give a movie-going gift, I'd suggest pretty much anything other than this. See if the theater has gift certificates. Give a pre-paid visa card. Anything. It's absurd that a gift card - which was paid for with cash - is about as convenient to use as an expired discount coupon you cut out of the back of a cereal box.

UPDATE: I finally used the cards by ordering some tickets online - and had to pay a CONVENIENCE FEE ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. Yes, for the non-convenience of not even being able to USE these unless I order ahead of time, four bucks of my son's cash was just sucked into the great aether.

I should have listened to the other reviews, but there were so many positive ones that I thought it must be a fluke or a glitch for some unfortunate people. I received the email with the gift card number and pin number. I went to Sephora to check out what I had in my cart, plugged in the numbers, and I got a message of this gift card has a 0$ balance. Thank God, it was only 25$, but that's still 25$ I'm out if the gift card team my complaint was issued to doesn't refund my credit card like they should.

Amazon customer service is a dead end, too. They'll try to get you to contact Sephora's customer service instead, but I'll tell you, right now, Sephora will do nothing for you because you purchased the card through Amazon and not THEIR company which issues Sephora gift cards through a company called LGCS Inc. Amazon gift cards and e-gift cards are through a company called ACI.

Here's Sephora's legalese: Sephora Gift Cards, eGift Cards, eGift Certificates, and Promotional Cards issued in the U.S. are issued by LGCS Inc., a Florida corporation, which is the sole legal obligor to the cardholder. Neither Sephora USA, Inc. nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (including Sephora Beauty Canada, Inc.) other than LGCS Inc. shall be liable to a cardholder with respect to Gift Cards, eGift Cards, eGift Certificates, and Promotional Cards issued in the U.S.

That should tell you everything you need to know that they can't and won't help you.

She kept on fighting with me verbally, kept asking have I read the promotional offer, did I read the words must be used.

I really am shocked why did she define her own promotional offer.

This is what the email from Amazon stated,

Buyer beware! Fandango created a business to make it easier to purchase movie tickets online. The idea is good, but there are so many opportunities for things to go wrong and Fandango Customer Service is beyond terrible. The chances of getting burned by buying this product is very high. Since Fandango is a separate company than the theaters they deal with, you have to deal directly with Fandango if there are any issues with your tickets- the theaters cannot (and will not) help you. Fandango redeemed a $50 gift card we had and never issued tickets; when we called customer service, we were on hold for almost an hour (during which time the movie we were trying to see started). After having no luck on the phone, I filed an online complaint. It took several days for them to get back to me (in the meantime, I called again the next day and was able to get through after about a 20 minute wait). Fandango refused to issue a refund because their policy is that refunds need to be requested before the start of the show. I'd like to know how that is even possible if customer service reps don't answer the phone and don't respond to emails for days. They figure people redeeming gift certificates won't push the issue since it was a gift (not their money). There are hundreds of negative reviews about this company.

I purchased a Dickey's e-mail gift certificate on Amazon.  The only option was a ""paper"" gift card that you print at home.  Problems with this paper gift card are:
1. It doesn't hold up to wear and tear like a plastic gift card.
2. Dickey's store locations have a very hard time accepting them.  They have to manually punch in the long gift card number several times before the system either works or doesn't work.
3. It's too easy for a store employee in some other far-away state to punch in the wrong certificate number and drain your certificate before you have a chance to use it.  THIS HAPPENED TO ME!  I live on the east coast and it was depleted by a store on the west coast.
4. When you report problems to Dickey's via their website you get no response.
5. When you report problems to Dickey's via a phone call voice message, you do get a response, but nothing happens.  This issue is still pending and it's been over a month since I reported it.
6. The problems that I am reporting are apparently widespread.  According to the reviews, you have more than a 1 in 4 chance of having these same problems happen to you.

I have 7 different, excellent, BBQ places near me.  This experience has already made me think several times about the frequency of my trips to Dickey's.  I still go, but it's getting less frequent.

UPDATE 09-27-17:
After 7 weeks of effort, I finally received a formal response.  They sent me three $10 certificates, each dated 09-07-17, good only at my local Dickey's BBQ location and expire 12-31-17.  I sent them back as an unacceptable response.  Why?  1. It was for less than they owed me.  2. The original certificates I purchased on Amazon were good at any location and did not expire; and 3. My local Dickey's BBQ location went out of business on 8-30-17 which was eight days before the new certificates were issued and sent to me.

Recommendations: 1. If you have a gift card, use it quick.  According to unhappyfranchisee.com, I understand that over 70 Dickey's BBQ locations have closed in 2017 in addition to my local store location.  2. If you do buy a gift card, be sure to buy the actual card (now available on Amazon, search for ASIN: B00VF0MTSA) and not this e-mail delivery gift card ASIN: B00MV9H2B8 that has had all the problems.

The have continuously changed and edited their Terms of Service without asking members to re-accept the new terms, as most legitimate organizations will do (most organizations let you know the TOS has changed, not the ECA).

Their Terms of Service clearly states AT THIS TIME they will change the expiration date on your credit card if your card expires.  They will change the expiration date until they get a ""hit"" to continue to charge you a fee.

If you try to simply cancel your credit card on file with them to stop them from charging you, their President has stated they will file fraud charges against you through your credit card company.

The only way to cancel your membership is by sending a snail mail letter.  Yes, you can sign up on their website very easily, but have to send a letter in the mail to cancel.  They also state they will not confirm receipt of your cancellation letter, meaning if it is ""lost"" in the mail, they will continue to charge you.

Their forums on their website have banned all new registrants the past few days without people even making one post.  New registrations to their forums have also been shut down at this time.

When your first year of membership is up, they say they will inform you with 30 days left that your account membership will be auto-renwed for another $20, problem is, if you want to cancel, they have to receive your letter in the mail BEFORE the final 30 days.  So when you get the notice that they are going to auto renew you for another year, it is already to late to cancel since you CANNOT cancel your membership on their website or by phone.

Finally, simply check out their Better Business Bureau rating.  It states as I type this that ""This business is not currently rated. BBB has recently received numerous complaints against this business, and will issue a rating after it has fully evaluated them.""

After almost a month, I finally asked what she had gotten with her gift certificate, and she said she never realized it was a gift card, but thought that it was just another Birthday Card greeting. And since it was sent to her Facebook account, she has been unable to locate her gift, since it is not account that she uses as email.

The advantage of the last minute gift card was to have it delivered before her Birthday had passed. Having to make it clear that, ""Hey, I sent you a gift card"" took that advantage away. Now, she has been completely unable to find or access her gift card. Can you please send her the gift card again, in a way that it is more clear that it is a gift certificate and not just a Birthday wish? I would truly appreciate it.

1,True,"06 22, 2016",A2Y0K3D0D8EQQE,test124,"Card number does not work in store. Some people have stated in their reviews that this is a cardboard card, but there is actually a plastic gift card within the cardboard carrier (confusing since the true gift card number is also printed on the cardboard carrier and starts after the 000's and is 16 digits total). You have to tear the cardboard carrier to remove the plastic card. I believe that either way, you have to manually enter the card number, because the bar code on both the cardboard carrier and the actual gift card looks the same and does not work. The store manager even tried to enter the number manually a few times. When I tried calling the number on the back of the gift card it asked me to enter the card number and a 4-digit pin (the 4 digit pin is not shown on the cardboard carrier, only shows on the plastic gift card). But it kept saying my entry was invalid. The Whole Foods website has an area to enter in the card info and pin but my entry was still invalid (I classified it as an online physical card and had to enter my zip code for further confirmation). All in all, this was a complete waste of time and an embarrassment as I held up the line and the fresh food that I was trying to buy probably went bad while I tried to figure this all out.

Then I found that the gift card approval email arrived  3 am today PDT. Totally unacceptable!

Amazon had an email link that showed up when I placed the order for cancellation, but I can no longer find it after the purchase.

When I was checking it out, it only gave me 2 options for shipping. one with 3-5 days, and one with two-days. There was no one-day as sparkled in the previous page! This is the first flaw. Without any other option, thou, I had to choose two-day, thinking it might make it in 2 days if they ship out right away. Wrong again!

The next day, I check the order status, it says it was being prepared to ship out.. meaning not shipped yet.. after 24 hours I placed an order.. Big second flaw. I chatted with Amazon to see if they could explain and help me. Guess what. Nothing they could do.. a response that I did not expected from Amazon.

Reason #1. ""free one-day delivery"" might have been a temporary promotion that they could not keep track of... which make no sense. They don't keep track of promotion???

Reason #2. ""Since the card had been loaded in the truck already, they could not do anything about it""..., which I interpreted as the order was sent to their vendor, and the vendor was taking time to actually ship out the card. Answers made no sense. Big third flaw.

Anyhow, I suggest the rep. that this misleading banner of ""Free One-day delivery"" should be removed, which I doubt she would. I wonder if they are out-sourcing customer service.

hope this information help someone making right decision.",Free One-Day Delivery is misleading !!!,1,i ordered gift card sister birthday nov two since i late thing birthday coming two day i excited see gift card free one day delivery turned completely misleading when i checking gave two option shipping one three five day one two day there one day sparkled previous page this first flaw without option thou i choose two day thinking might make two day ship right away wrong the next day i check order status say prepared ship meaning shipped yet twenty-four hour i placed order big second flaw i chatted amazon see could explain help guess nothing could response i expected amazon reason one free one day delivery might temporary promotion could keep track make sense they keep track promotion reason two since card loaded truck already could anything i interpreted order sent vendor vendor taking time actually ship card answers made sense big third flaw anyhow i suggest rep misleading banner free one day delivery removed i doubt would i wonder sourcing customer service hope information help someone making right decision

Next, if you ARE able to navigate their website and give them the appropriate ""Code Numbers"" on the card (which you'll probably spend 30 minutes wondering why they keep telling you your entering an ""Invalid Code"") you can purchase your movie tickets.

1,True,"05 17, 2017",A2B7F89W9F8BUS,BKAZmom,"I purchased these gift cards as part of a promotion Amazon was running.  I will upload a photo of the email I received.  In the email it stated ""Get $15.00 Amazon credit with a $50 Amazon gift card purchase"".  It's the end of the school year, so I purchased 3 $50.00 gift card for my kids teachers.  I figured that was a great deal for both of us, I spend $35.00 and they get $50.00 for their classroom.

Four days later I attempt to purchase a birthday present and was reminded to check on my $45.00 credit I thought I had coming.  I couldn't find it, used all their ""self help"" links, and finally found a phone number to speak to a human and get help.  First lady was wonderful, told me the reason I didn't get it was because I had purchased all three in one transaction, instead of 3.  I thought that was silly so I asked for a supervisor.

The supervisor, Deo located in the Philippines, was the supervisor I was connected to.  He informed me what the email really meant was ONE $15.00 credit for purchasing OVER $50.00 in gift cards.  Clearly that email is open to interpretation.  He said it was written in the terms and conditions...however when I tried to read them for myself I was sent to a different screen (picture attached).  I asked to speak with his supervisor, to which he informed me he is the very top of the customer service center.  I asked for his boss.  He said he was only authorized to give me a mailing address.  Dumbfounded I asked him if Amazon corporate office in Washington does not have phones or email.  He said they are only allowed to contact them via their computer system.

Most of my conversation with Deo was in silence.  I'm assuming he was typing up everything I was saying for amazon's records.  54 minutes into my conversation the line disconnected and they never called back.  I called back to get amazon's address and was surprisingly connected to a customer service rep who worked in the same department as Deo.  He spoke with Deo (who was unable to speak with me since he was busy with another customer).  The new customer service rep, Ian, could not have been kinder and more professional.  I felt like he was actually listening to my complaint verse Deo who just wanted to record every little thing I said.

Ian helped me get the contact information I needed, and also gave me the email address of where I could forward a copy of the email in question.  Ian also provided me with the PO Box for Amazon Corporate Office in Seattle.  Since I can not voice my compliant to Amazon corporate office directly, and I must write a letter, I figured I would share it with all who would listen.  I hope your Amazon experience is better than mine.  And Deo, you might want to pay attention to Ian and Mercy - they are customer service pros.

Long story short, Amazon - who is worth $430 BILLION - would rather lose a long time customer over $30.  But as for the product, it was adorable and looked great in my candy bouquets.  I'll attach a picture of that too.",Don't believe the promotion emails - out $45.00,1,i purchased gift card part promotion amazon running i upload photo email i received in email stated get fifteen zero amazon credit fifty amazon gift card purchase it end school year i purchased three fifty zero gift card kid teacher i figured great deal u i spend thirty-five zero get fifty zero classroom four day later i attempt purchase birthday present reminded check forty-five zero credit i thought i coming i find used self help link finally found phone number speak human get help first lady wonderful told reason i get i purchased three one transaction instead three i thought silly i asked supervisor the supervisor deo located philippines supervisor i connected he informed email really meant one fifteen zero credit purchasing over fifty zero gift card clearly email open interpretation he said written term condition however i tried read i sent different screen picture attached i asked speak supervisor informed top customer service center i asked bos he said authorized give mailing address dumbfounded i asked amazon corporate office washington phone email he said allowed contact via computer system most conversation deo silence i assuming typing everything i saying amazon record fifty-four minute conversation line disconnected never called back i called back get amazon address surprisingly connected customer service rep worked department deo he spoke deo unable speak since busy another customer the new customer service rep ian could kinder professional i felt like actually listening complaint verse deo wanted record every little thing i said ian helped get contact information i needed also gave email address i could forward copy email question ian also provided po box amazon corporate office seattle since i voice compliant amazon corporate office directly i must write letter i figured i would share would listen i hope amazon experience better mine and deo might want pay attention ian mercy customer service pro long story short amazon worth four hundred and thirty billion would rather lose long time customer thirty but product adorable looked great candy bouquet i attach picture

Mind you this is the same card I've been using on Amazon for *years* and it isn't close to expiry, nor is it close to the credit limit, so I didn't see what the problem was, but I waited some more.  When another 30 minutes passed and the email still had not appeared I called customer service.  (We had reached the point where it was time to leave for the party we'd bought the card for.)
The customer service person was not very helpful, and apparently not very bright.  I explained that I'd been waiting for 45 minutes, and he said ""Yes, I think we can help you within the next 45 minutes.""  I tried again, saying that I had *already* been waiting 45 minutes, and it was time for me to leave the house, and could he please see what the problem was quickly.  He came back and told me that they were verifying my credit card.  Again, I explained that I *knew* that from my status check, but I wanted to know *why* they were still verifying.  He put me on hold to check on it.  About 5 minutes later he came back on the line and told me that the problem was taken care of, and that I would be getting the email with instructions to print the gift card within the next 24 hours.  At this point I had pretty much lost my patience.  I told him that I didn't need it in 24 hours, I needed it NOW, which was the whole point of the stupid thing.  I told him that he'd better put a manager on the phone right away, and that if my problem wasn't fixed they would loose me and my family as customers.
Luckily the manager seemed to be a smart person.  I was on hold for another 5 minutes before the manager got on the phone.  When she did get on, she told me that she'd taken care of the problem, and would I please check my email one more time.  Thank goodness the email was there, and I was able to immediately print the gift card, and we were only about 15 minutes late for our party.

I do think these printable gift cards are a great idea, and have been happy with them in the past.  I don't know what happened that made my ""instant"" order take over an hour this time, but it will definitely make me think twice before using this product next time.  My recommendation to anyone who uses it in the future will be ""Don't wait until the last minute.""  I find this sad, because that is supposed to be the beauty of the thing.  Oh well.  I hope it was just a one-time fluke.

My local Safeway, Store #1889, treated me like a criminal. I'd actually stopped going to this store for some time already, because of its high prices and general dissatisfaction...but, since this was the best I could do, with the eCard offerings Amazon gave me, I thought I'd try.

My local store at first just told me no, and hoped I'd leave. But, I wanted my groceries...so, I used their phone; called the numbers on the printout (doing their job of customer service); and, convinced the floor manager to  talk the Gift Card people. She hung up and told me she still didn't trust me; went to talk to the store manager (which they had already told me had left for the day, Hmmm?); and, then she said it was OK...and processed the card.

THEN, she said she had to keep the printout...and, since I still had a balance, I said, ""No, that's my card. I can still use it.""...and she said she needed it for her records, and kept it.

The only saving grace is that the eCard actually worked, and I got my stuff...AND, that when I got home and called Safeway corporate (# on receipt), they were very nice; they called the store and told them to give me back my printout; and, when I went to get it...they didn't give me any guff.

PROS:
- Can be shipped to address of person receiving gift
- Limited capability to send personalized message.

CONS:
- Likely due to UPS issues ... Not Delivered on Expected Date (projected to be 2-3 days late)
- Likely due to UPS issues ... Confusing delivery status info.
- Inconsistent experience to personalize messages
- Inflexible ... Message can  (& can not) be printed on Card

ACI Gift Cards, Inc. ... Ordered Amazon & Starbucks gift cards.  A Holiday Card comes with the Amazon gift card, but a personalized message can not be printed on it (only on the invoice).  However, for the Starbucks gift card, you can pay extra to add a Holiday Card with a personalized message.  Expected Delivery for both cards is now 2-3 days beyond the 'original' expected delivery date (likely due to UPS issues reported in National News for Holidays).  SUMMARY: This service allows you to select a gift card and ship it to the address of the person receiving the gift.  However, it is inconsistent in allowing a personal message to be added to a Holiday Card.  Problematic delivery may be due to UPS problems BUT to be sure read product & seller reviews to confirm delivery performance.  If you want to personalize a Holiday or Birthday card to be sent with your gift card, you may be better served buying a gift card and Holiday Card locally and using an expedited shipping method.",Disappointing Experience ...

I would like to note here that Staples will not accept the use of a Staples eCard for an Online Purchase at all.
We had received several gift cards for our credit card reward point with the plan of making an iPod Touch purchase from staples and as we live an hour away from the nearest store we planed to use these gift cards in an online purchase.
During the check out process of the online purchase only five cards could be entered so we called Staples Customer Support and were informed that only 5 gift cards could be used for an online purchase.  We asked if we went to the store could we use all of our gift cards there to purchase what we wanted and the Customer Service Representative response was to the effect that Staples limits any purchase to 5 gift cards online or in store.
We asked why wasn't this disclosed at the time of purchase and the Customer Service Representative didn't have a response for this question.
Fortunately we decided to call a store and ask if we could make a purchase using more than 5 gift cards and the Store Representative informed us that we could use as many as we wanted.

3,False,"03 25, 2015",A2BACCF5DUV2KV,Christina B.,"I read many of the reviews here in an attempt to better understand how Spa Finder works. I did this because when trying to redeem my Spa Finder gift cards that my mom sent me for my birthday, my spa did not have a clear policy on what I could use them for and gave me a confusing explanation of how I could not use the gift card for discounted packages because I had received a discount when purchasing the gift card. First, my mom paid full price for the gift cards, so there was no discount. I had a long conversation with the owner and did some of my own research. What I learned is that Spa Finder makes money by charging a commission to the spa on the redemption of cards. In essence, Spa Finder only reimburses the spa for a percentage of the card. There is no discount to the client in purchasing the card, so spas should be aware that just because Spa Finder does not reimburse them in full for the gift cards does not mean that client received a discount (it's not a coupon or a voucher). Many of the reviews have advised to either just give the person money or a gift card directly from the spa to avoid these hassles. I have a different take on this. My mom lives across the country and she gave me these gift cards because it is more personal than sending a check or cash, and it ensures that I will use it for its intended purpose. She could not buy a card directly from the spa because of her location. Whatever you think of Spa Finder as a company, spas choose to participate in the Spa Finder program as a way of building their clientele. It is a legitimate business decision, and the price is the monthly fee the spas pay as well as the commissions on each card that is redeemed at their location. While the fees may be higher, this is a similar concept to the charges that credit card companies place on each transaction. Regardless of the transaction charges, business accept credit cards as convenience to customers so they can build their customer base. Similarly, spas participate in the Spa Finder program to build their clientele. The Spa Finder program is not mandatory, and spas know about the charges before they sign up. I do not feel sorry for spas that choose to participate in this program, so talk of ""supporting"" your local spa falls on deaf ears with me. A spa is not a charity that needs my support. It is a business just like any other, and I expect the spas listed on the website to accept the cards as payment. If the cost of participating in the Spa Finder program outweighs the benefits, they should not participate. Similarly, it they no longer wish to participate, they should remove their name from the Spa Finder website and place a notice on their own website that they no longer participate in the program. Spas should really think about how participating in the program will affect their business rather than leaving it up to the client to wade through the technicalities. I recommended to the owner of my spa that they add a section to their policy page explaining that because of the commissions they pay on the Spa Finder cards, clients can redeem the cards only for full-priced services and cannot apply the cards to discounted packages. Spas can develop any policy that serves their business best, but whatever the policy, it should be clearly stated to the client upfront. I gave this three stars because that means that its OK. Not great, not bad, but OK. I think it could be great, but there are obviously some things to be worked out on Spa Finder's part (based on other reviews) as well as that of businesses participating in the program. Right now, the potential loser in this situation is the client.",... many of the reviews here in an attempt to better understand how Spa Finder works,0,i read many review attempt better understand spa finder work i trying redeem spa finder gift card mom sent birthday spa clear policy i could use gave confusing explanation i could use gift card discounted package i received discount purchasing gift card first mom paid full price gift card discount i long conversation owner research what i learned spa finder make money charging commission spa redemption card in essence spa finder reimburses spa percentage card there discount client purchasing card spa aware spa finder reimburse full gift card mean client received discount coupon voucher many review advised either give person money gift card directly spa avoid hassle i different take my mom life across country gave gift card personal sending check cash ensures i use intended purpose she could buy card directly spa location whatever think spa finder company spa choose participate spa finder program way building clientele it legitimate business decision price monthly fee spa pay well commission card redeemed location while fee may higher similar concept charge credit card company place transaction regardless transaction charge business accept credit card convenience customer build customer base similarly spa participate spa finder program build clientele the spa finder program mandatory spa know charge sign i feel sorry spa choose participate program talk supporting local spa fall deaf ear a spa charity need support it business like i expect spa listed website accept card payment if cost participating spa finder program outweighs benefit participate similarly longer wish participate remove name spa finder website place notice website longer participate program spas really think participating program affect business rather leaving client wade technicality i recommended owner spa add section policy page explaining commission pay spa finder card client redeem card full priced service cannot apply card discounted package spas develop policy serf business best whatever policy clearly stated client upfront i gave three star mean ok not great bad ok i think could great obviously thing worked spa finder part based review well business participating program right potential loser situation client

I bought the Fire and created a seperate account for his Fire (I don't want him charging my credit card directly). I attached a gift card to the account and then registered the Kindle to that account. I verified that everything worked. I was able to get free books, and free music. Then I tried to get the daily free app and recieved an error message saying I needed to have a credit card attached to account to buy apps.

Thinking that couldn't be true I contacted Amazon customer support. After 45 minutes on the phone they confirmed that you can not purchase Kindle Fire Apps (even free ones) using a gift card. You must have credit card attached to the account to purchase apps.

In other words, gift cards can't be used like credit cards or cash. There are things you can't buy with them on Amazon.

Other than this issue, I'm happy with the Kindle Fire.

This may sound nit-picky, but consider this- just after Christmas, on Amazon.co.uk there was a sale- the ""Twelve Days of Kindle"" sale.  Loads of Kindle Books for real cheap.  I got excited, browsed through, chose which ones I was going to use my gift card on, and was set to check out.  Looking at the check out page, though, I realized I wasn't going to be able to use the gift card, as it was only good on the US Amazon, not the UK Amazon.

I'm not ungrateful- $100 of free books is great, even if there are limitations.  But why do those limitations exist?  It's the same company, just a different country.  I haven't really looked into the legal complications, so perhaps there's a good reason why they legally can't allow us to use both sites.  However, to a layman just using the site, it seems a bit unfair that although I'm allowed to buy products from the two (separate, yes, yet identical down to, for all intents and purposes, the logo) sites using the same log-in name, I can't use my gift card on both.

If you're trying to take advantage of 6 months no interest/5% back with the the Amazon card, I recommend planning ahead a couple of days and ordering the physical gift cards. These e-mails aren't quite reliable enough.

My experience:

- Purchased four $100 gift cards
- Received confirmation from Amazon in about 5 minutes
- Received the gift cards about 45 minutes later- sweet!
- Clicked ""Get Gift Card"" in the first e-mail, a page opened, but nothing loaded
- Tried the remaining three emails, those links didn't work either
- Contacted customer service via phone, spoke with a lady that had a hard time even taking my order # (bad sign), let alone addressing the issue; eventually asked to be transferred
- A couple more transfers/calls and still little to no help
- Resent the cards to myself (your account > your orders > resend e-mail)
- Two hours later the status still says ""scheduled""
- Attempted to chat with Juan, we were disconnected a couple of times, but he said he'd need to forward to the gift card department and it could take 1-2 days to hear back... to which I replied, ""That's unacceptable. Cancel the order...""
- We were disconnected again, then Gurpreet connected
- I explained that I expected to be able to use the gift cards nearly immediately, but since that didn't appear to be an option I wanted to cancel the order
- After about ten minutes, he came back and wasn't able to help... he, too, need to contact the gift card department and it'd be about 24-48 before the order would be canceled.

UPDATE:

Working cards finally arrived about 10 hours after I received confirmation of my order. I visited Gamestop's site and verified the Card #s + PINs- all worked and the balances were correct.

UPDATE 2:

Well, they finally got around to cancelling the cards now that they worked. This is the most incompetent customer service I've have ever experienced.

UPDATE 3:

Purchased the cards again while I wait for my balance to be restored. Worked flawlessly this time.

I have purchased them for family members, for friends, for inamorata, and for myself, so that when Im strolling through the mall, or out busily driving to and fro in my car, Ill stop and think: THE OLIVE GARDEN. I would no doubt think of it anyway, because once you have experienced their food, theres no going back to anything lesser (CHILIS). Their alfredo sauce will almost make your mouth stagger off your face in delight.

The last time I was there, I asked SCOTT the waiter for more breadsticks, and he promptly brought them. I asked him if he thought ZITI was a strange name for a food, and he said hed never thought about it before. It sounds like a noise an animal makes, I said. Just because it sounds funny, SCOTT explained, doesnt mean it doesn't taste good. SCOTT, I said, that is very true. Then we both leaned back and enjoyed a laugh. Someone should give SCOTT a promotion.

I would offer one complaint about this fine restaurant, which is that they are fairly inflexible about letting you customize your dining experience. I know a local singer-songwriter, IVAN MALESKY, M.D, and a few months ago, I tried to hire him to serenade my table at the local OG. He is perhaps best known for the song My Neighbor's Shoes, a marvelous, uplifting song about fellowship and brotherhood. It was followed by the sequels Neighbor's Pants, Neighbors Robe, and Neighbor's Wife, a series that becomes increasingly vehement and artistically challenging. But I assured the OLIVE GARDEN he would express only mainstream emotions during his time in their fine establishment.

No response.

I wrote again to assure them that the man is extremely low-maintenance. He brings his own stepladder and has a surprisingly easygoing demeanor. He would touch their patrons in a metaphorical way ONLY, with a profound basso mysterioso that shivers the heart strings to the timeless frequencies of human longing. His actual hands he would keep to himself. I imagined he would run through his repertoire of popular standards and then do some hingeless jazz soloing when the food arrived. He would of course ask for tips, I cautioned, or have his assistant BON waddle around with a hat. But this gives the performance a classic, outdoor feel, and allows IVAN to finance his disparate endeavors.

No response.

I admit at this point getting a little bit gravely disappointed in the OLIVE GARDEN. It seemed inexplicable to me that my favorite restaurant would refuse to EVEN ANSWER a loyal patron after so many unbroken of friendship and what they call HOSPITALIANO. I thought back over all those meals Ive had, and all those times I plunked five or six new gift card on the table at once, as if to say lets make something happen. So in a fit of what might be called FRUSTRANGINI, I did something that, I must confess, I am not proud of. It is hard for me to admit, but in the interests of full disclosure, I will say it.

I went to BENNIGANS.

Perhaps six times. It was not the same. Its not that the food is bad at BENNIGANS  one time I had the lemonish salad with chicken fragments over spicey spice. But it just lacks that special something. You just don't feel like you're being swept away to a faraway place, as you do in the OLIVE GARDEN. I think thats why I enjoy the GIFT CARDS so much, for they add to the fantasy of being outside the usual parameters of time and space. Also I did not have the same kind of jokey rapport with the waitstaff at BENNIGANS. This is not a knock on BRITTNEY, KAYLA, JOSH, RICKI or LINBEE who were all very prompt and competent (except JOSH), but they did not have the expertise that you find with a SCOTT. Also my water had something floating in it. I don't think it was a flea, but I also don't think it was something a patron wants to have to try to block with his lips while he tries to enjoy his water.

This experience made me realize that the OLIVE GARDEN is more than just food served on plates by waiters for money: theres an idea there. Its an idea about returning to a simpler time and a simpler place that echoes deep within the bowels of the human heart. You can see why they are the worlds most successful horizontally distributed multinational restaurant conglomeration.

OG finally did respond to my questions, with a firm but polite NO. It didn't matter, because the special event had come and gone, and MALESKY had stopped doing restaurant work to focus his energy on studio recording and his various ongoing lawsuits.

Despite this disappointment, I did return. Indeed, I have decided to put aside our differences, and continue to enjoy an exhilarating, food-based relationship with the OG. Theres just something about the place that makes it impossible to stay away for long. Also, I had four gift cards left. But in this way, reader, we come full circle to the true value of the gift card. Sometimes, it forces you to eat at OLIVE GARDEN when you really don't want to. But youll always be glad you did.",I write to recommend these gift cards as a handsome addition to anyones ...,0,i write recommend gift card handsome addition anyones pocket i purchased family member friend inamorata im strolling mall busily driving fro car ill stop think the olive garden i would doubt think anyway experienced food there going back anything lesser chilis their alfredo sauce almost make mouth stagger face delight the last time i i asked scott waiter breadstick promptly brought i asked thought ziti strange name food said hed never thought it sound like noise animal make i said just sound funny scott explained doesnt mean taste good scott i said true then leaned back enjoyed laugh someone give scott promotion i would offer one complaint fine restaurant fairly inflexible letting customize dining experience i know local singer songwriter ivan malesky m d month ago i tried hire serenade table local og he perhaps best known song my neighbor shoes marvelous uplifting song fellowship brotherhood it followed sequel neighbor pants neighbors robe neighbor wife series becomes increasingly vehement artistically challenging but i assured olive garden would express mainstream emotion time fine establishment no response i wrote assure man extremely low maintenance he brings stepladder surprisingly easygoing demeanor he would touch patron metaphorical way only profound basso mysterioso shiver heart string timeless frequency human longing his actual hand would keep i imagined would run repertoire popular standard hingeless jazz soloing food arrived he would course ask tip i cautioned assistant bon waddle around hat but give performance classic outdoor feel allows ivan finance disparate endeavor no response i admit point getting little bit gravely disappointed olive garden it seemed inexplicable favorite restaurant would refuse even answer loyal patron many unbroken friendship call hospitaliano i thought back meal ive time i plunked five six new gift card table say let make something happen so fit might called frustrangini i something i must confess i proud it hard admit interest full disclosure i say i went bennigans perhaps six time it its food bad bennigans one time i lemonish salad chicken fragment spicey spice but lack special something you feel like swept away faraway place olive garden i think thats i enjoy gift cards much add fantasy outside usual parameter time space also i kind jokey rapport waitstaff bennigans this knock brittney kayla josh ricki linbee prompt competent except josh expertise find scott also water something floating i think flea i also think something patron want try block lip try enjoy water this experience made realize olive garden food served plate waiter money there idea its idea returning simpler time simpler place echo deep within bowel human heart you see world successful horizontally distributed multinational restaurant conglomeration og finally respond question firm polite no it matter special event come gone malesky stopped restaurant work focus energy studio recording various ongoing lawsuit despite disappointment i return indeed i decided put aside difference continue enjoy exhilarating food based relationship og theres something place make impossible stay away long also i four gift card left but way reader come full circle true value gift card sometimes force eat olive garden really want but youll always glad

4,True,"08 9, 2013",A2T1LZWRGLYJTT,Kate,"I love the gift cards and send them electronically all the time.

As a sender, you can check if your electronic gift card was redeemed.

However, I discovered recently that someone I'd sent a gift card to back in 2008 had never redeemed it.  There it was showing in my sent gift certificates, still valid and unredeemed.  Other recipients have kept the certificates for months before redemption.  It becomes awkward when you wonder if they forgot the gift was there, never got the email, or were just ""saving it up.""

Yes, this can happen with traditional gift cards going unused, but since this can be more easily avoided wih an electronic gift card, why not avoid the problem?

The thing many people don't realize is that unlike traditional gift cards, you can redeem Amazon gift certificates the day you get the gift card, and the money will wait in your Amazon account until use.  I think this could be stated up front, so people would not hesitate and wait to ""find something they want"".  Unfortunately, Amazon probably is counting on some people never redeeming the code, so they can keep the money.  And that kind of stinks.  (No different than with brick-and-mortar gift cards, but still.)

It would be easy to tell recipients in the gift card email that they should enter the code right away.  But if Amazon won't tell people this, make sure you do!","I buy these all the time, but I wish they would warn recipients...",0,i love gift card send electronically time as sender check electronic gift card redeemed however i discovered recently someone i sent gift card back two thousand and eight never redeemed there showing sent gift certificate still valid unredeemed other recipient kept certificate month redemption it becomes awkward wonder forgot gift never got email saving yes happen traditional gift card going unused since easily avoided wih electronic gift card avoid problem the thing many people realize unlike traditional gift card redeem amazon gift certificate day get gift card money wait amazon account use i think could stated front people would hesitate wait find something want unfortunately amazon probably counting people never redeeming code keep money and kind stink no different brick mortar gift card still it would easy tell recipient gift card email enter code right away but amazon tell people make sure

That money is used to run their business so you can use a service like theirs.

Please be aware of this convenience fee before buying this gift card. Yes, it's easy to complain and moan, as I did myself, but realize that the ""convenience fee"" is to save you *time* from having to stand in a lineespecially for a crowded opening night movie. For those that value their time, that is worth the fee. However, this fee is steadily increasing over the years, along with movie prices, so it's becoming a harder to justify the service.

5,True,"03 28, 2014",A2KQPQZX4E08Z0,Frances Cristina,"I love giving Amazon Gift Cards. They are easy to give and easy to receive. I know some people may have reservations about gift cards, feeling that they aren't personal enough. I think they are perfect though. It can be difficult to choose the perfect gift these days. It is easy, even when using wish lists, to buy something someone else already chose. Then the recipient needs to decide what to do with the duplicate. Stress. Or you choose something you think is great but it misses the mark. Hurt feelings. With a gift card you have shown the person that you think they are special and you care enough to give them what makes them happy. With an Amazon gift card you have given them the opportunity to go shopping, in their jammies or comfy clothes, (for some people, I guess no clothes - I don't want to think about that lol), a cup of coffee, hot chocolate or whatever brew floats their boat, sitting in the comfort of their own home. No weather to worry about, no traffic jams, no parking issues, no crowds and no wondering if it will be in stock when you get there. Hassle free, relaxed shopping. They can do it alone or invite someone, maybe you, to go shopping with them. Amazon offers thousands of choices on how to spend their gift cards, some of the best customer service if there is an issue, and if a prime membership is involved, 2 days and it is there! Woot! Woot!

The only change I might like to see with gift cards is the ability to choose whether or not I want to use the gift card for a purchase. With a store gift card, I can save it to combine with another gift card to purchase a big ticket item. It is the one thing I wish I could do with Amazon Gift Cards. It would really be cool to have a box I can check that states you have a gift card total of $xxx.xx. Would you like to use this to pay for your purchase?

5,True,"09 7, 2016",AK3402G7FO7AY,JMK,"This review is for the Amazon Gift Card (any amount) in the Mini Amazon Shipping Box:

Do you get excited when your Amazon Shipment arrives at your door? The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!

The little brown box is about 4.5"" x 3"" x 1"" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.

Open the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the ""Thank you"" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.

It arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.

Would it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.

Recommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!

Ideas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other ""thank you"" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.

At the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.

Love this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars. Happy Shopping! :)",If you Love Amazon Deliveries & seeing that box arrive at your door,0,this review amazon gift card amount mini amazon shipping box do get excited amazon shipment arrives door the sight brown amazon box excitement getting new delivery if going love little gift box gift card come i ordered many amazon tin greeting card one favorite it super adorable great way give gift card amazon fan the little brown box four five x three x one tall the inside come removable brown flap hold gift card perfectly open flap reveals gift card inside the top flap seem like magnetic go reclose snap back place the bottom clear window allows see inside small print back amazon gift card made china i chose thank gift card see attached pic this little gift box come free purchase gift card you reuse swap gift card choose it arrives inside outer box arrive safe sound would make great gift definitely amazon great card give so many choice spend unlike gift card stuck particular retailer restaurant etc give variety i like purchasing gift card twenty-five quantity i quick gift hand case i need quick unexpected gift recommended i recommend anyone love shopping amazon if gift recipient love getting amazon brown box delivery giddy see adorable box ideas you purchase swap gift card so example doesnt appear still offering thank card box like i bought you could purchase one thank gift card box card etc purchase one mini box one swap two card or use one gift card future purchase at time i writing review appears purchase gift card twenty-five two thousand amount there two post particular mini box style birthday icon classic white gift card offering love little brown box i ordering five stars happy shopping
